      <p>
        Your personal data, which is in particular your main data (last name,
        first name, date of birth, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax
        number, date of birth, customer number) as well as language,
      </p>
      <p>
        the data of the payment type and in connection with payments, especially
        with EC-cards (debit cards), credit cards and bank cards,
      </p>
      <p>
        is needed for our services. These services include the mediation of your
        provided services offered by you (training sessions, nutritional advice)
        to users of our website through profiling their voluntarily provided
        data, as well as the billing and their evaluation. This data is saved,
        processed and, if necessary, provided to third parties with whom we
        cooperate to provide the most effective and best-possible service to our
        customers – these could also include service providers in third-party
        countries as contract processors, software and agency service providers.
        In the course of profiling your data – which is voluntarily provided by
        you - we create your coaching or nutritionist advisor profile. Our users
        contact you by using the means of communication that you have provided
        in order to use your services.
      </p>
      <p>The legal bases for these data processing procedures are</p>
      <p>
        the fulfillment of our pre-contractual and contractual obligations
        towards you,
      </p>
      <p>consents obtained by you,</p>
      <p>
        statutory, contractual or other legal obligations on our part (e.g.
        documentation rights and obligations according to the accounting, tax
        and customs law, contract administration, reporting administration,
        legal disputes) and § 96 Telecommunication Act and our legitimate
        interests (e.g. the improving of our customer service, also in the area
        of direct advertising or the execution of our own legal interests).
      </p>
      <p>
        The duration of the storage depends on the duration of our business
        relationship, the consents given by you, beyond that according to the
        statutory storage obligations and legal obligations that apply to us. We
        emphasize that we endeavour to know your customer wishes that have
        already been conveyed to us so well that we can satisfy you constantly
        and permanently in the case of a regular cooperation for our best
        possible customer service.

      <p>
        By accessing our website, your access data will be automatically
        collected and saved. These access data may include, in particular the
        accessed page, the viewed files, the date and time of the access, the
        IP-address of the user, data of the accessing computer, in particular
        the browser and the operating system, as well as the data volume and the
        report of the successful access. These access data are used by us for
        internal statistical purposes in order to ensure the security of our
        offer and to optimize the offer. If an unlawful act is suspected, the
        access data will be evaluated to secure evidence. <br />By entering your
        personal data in one of our contact forms, you give your consent to the
        transmission and storage and processing by us for the duration of this
        specific request. This applies especially to your requests through the
        contact form, chat and e-mails that you send us. We need this data to
        process your request and in these cases, we also store your IP-address
        for the purpose of securing evidence. The storage takes place as long as
        this is necessary for the care of any supplementary or subsequently
        asked questions by you or us. <br />If you create a coach or
        nutritionist advisor account with us, we provide you with your contract
        data online. You carefully save your access data and ensure that no
        unauthorized persons access the account. We assume no liability for
        unauthorized accesses, which are - even if only partially - due to a
        misconduct on your part. <br />The data of your account will only be
        transferred through an encrypted internet connection (https). We assume
        no liability for the loss of data or the access of third parties to your
        data, if we have followed the security measures required by the state of
        the art.<br />
        The legal basis for these data processings is your consent, our
        pre-contractual and contractual obligations to you, our legitimate
        interests and legal obligations of all kinds and § 96 Telecommunication
        Act.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Your personal data is possibly forwarded by us within the group, taking
        the permitted uses into account, to contract processors (e.g. our
        electronic advertisements in the form of newsletters) as well as to

        applicable data protection standards. <br />If the compliance with the
        European data protection standards is not possible - for example,
        because standard contractual clauses, adequacy decisions or
        certifications are not guaranteed in the specific case - we will inform
        you in advance and will also ask you for your necessary consents. For

        our offers comfortable for you. Your recognized and stored information
        by cookies is used for your recognition, but also for the analysis of
        your user behaviour.<br />
        They are saved on the server of the respective provider, who has
        committed himself as a contract processor to us to comply with the
        applicable data protection standards. <br />After you have visited our

        a priori or you do not actively delete cookies. The active disabling of
        cookies may affect the functionality of our websites for you. You can
        prevent the saving of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser
        software. <br />However, we point out to you that in this case you may
        not be able to use all the features of our website.<br />
        Moreover, you can also prevent the forwarding of data (including your
        IP-address) to Google created by the cookie and with regard to your use
        of the website, as well as the processing of such data by Google, by
        downloading and installing the browser plugin available on the
        google.com website. However, the plug-in is only available for certain

        We also use third-party content on our website in order to make our

        Concerning this matter, we refer to the declaration of data protection

        analytics service provided by Google Inc. 1600, Amphitheatre Parkway,
        Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies.
        The information about your user behaviour generated by the cookie is
        generally forwarded to a Google server in the USA and saved there.
        <br />Before this, your IP-address is shortened within the European
        Union and thus anonymized or at least pseudo-anonymized. Only in
        exceptional cases, the full IP-address is transmitted to a server of
        Google in the USA and shortened there. <br />Google uses this
        information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports
        about the website activities and to provide further services related to
        the website use and internet use to the website operator. The IP-address
        forwarded by Google Analytics in the framework of Google Analytics won’t
        be merged with other Google data. In this context, please also note the
        data protection policies of Google, especially the information available

        is opening our website. If the visitor is also registered and logged in
        to Facebook as a user, then further information of Facebook is saved
        too. Facebook receives your IP-address out of technical reasons. We have
