                  If you cancel this contract, we have to repay all payments
                  that we have received from you, including shipping charges
                  (except for the additional costs arising when choosing a

                  fourteen days from the date on which the notification of your
                  revocation of this contract has reached us. For this
                  repayment, we use the same means of payment that you have used
                  in the original transaction, unless something else has been
                  explicitly agreed on with you; we won’t ever charge you any
                  fees for this repayment.

                  If you have requested that the services should start during
                  the revocation period, you must pay us a reasonable amount
                  equal to the proportion of services compared to the total
                  scope of the provided services in this contract, which were
                  already provided until the time you notify us about exercising
                  the right of revocation.

                  The right of revocation expires in the case of a contract for
                  the provision of services, even if the entrepreneur has
                  provided the service completely and has only begun to carry
                  out the service after which the consumer has expressly agreed
                  that the entrepreneur starts with the execution of the
                  contract before the expiration of the revocation period and
